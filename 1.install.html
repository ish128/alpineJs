        Alpine is a collection of 15 attributes, 6 properties, and 2 methods.   
    </p>
    <p>There are 2 ways to include Alpine into your project:
            <ul>
                <li>Including it from a "script" tag in head tag
                    (이때, defer를 꼭 사용해라!)
                </li>
                <li>Importing it as a module</li>
            </ul>
